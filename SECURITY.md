1. **Email us directly** at: [security@yourproject.com](mailto:security@yourproject.com)
2. **Include the following information:**
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce the issue
   - Potential impact
   - Any suggested fixes (if available)
   - Your contact information

### 📋 What to Include

When reporting a vulnerability, please provide:

- **Type of vulnerability** (e.g., SQL injection, XSS, authentication bypass)
- **Location** of the vulnerability (file path, URL, function name)
- **Steps to reproduce** with detailed instructions
- **Proof of concept** or exploit code (if applicable)
- **Impact assessment** - what an attacker could achieve
- **Suggested mitigation** (if you have ideas)

### ⏰ Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours of report
- **Assessment**: Within 7 days
- **Fix Timeline**: Depends on severity
  - Critical: 1-3 days
  - High: 1-2 weeks
  - Medium: 2-4 weeks

### 🏆 Recognition

We believe in recognizing security researchers who help us improve our security:

- **Hall of Fame**: Listed in our security acknowledgments
- **Public Thanks**: Recognition in release notes (with permission)
- **Swag**: Project merchandise for significant findings

### 🔍 Security Best Practices

#### For Contributors

- **Never commit secrets** (API keys, passwords, tokens)
- **Use environment variables** for sensitive configuration
- **Validate all inputs** on both client and server side
- **Follow OWASP guidelines** for web application security
- **Keep dependencies updated** using `npm audit`

#### For Users

- **Keep the application updated** to the latest version
- **Use strong authentication** with Clerk's security features
- **Protect your environment variables** and API keys
- **Monitor your deployed applications** for unusual activity
- **Use HTTPS** in production environments

### 🚨 Known Security Considerations

#### Current Implementation

- **Authentication**: Handled by Clerk (industry-standard security)
- **Database**: Prisma ORM with parameterized queries (SQL injection protection)
- **API Routes**: Input validation with Zod schemas
- **File Uploads**: Not currently implemented (reduces attack surface)
- **Rate Limiting**: Recommended for production deployments

#### Recommended Production Setup

```bash
# Environment Security
- Use strong, unique DATABASE_URL
- Rotate API keys regularly
- Enable Clerk's security features
- Set up proper CORS policies
- Use Content Security Policy (CSP)
- Enable HTTPS only
```
